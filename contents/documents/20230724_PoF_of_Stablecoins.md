title: 'Potential Points of Failure for Stablecoins'
author: "Decentralized Treasury Working Group"
abstract: "This paper analyzes the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on stablecoins and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem in March 2023. Understanding the unfolding of events and identifying commonalities between classic and emerging financial systems will help harmonize balance between innovation and stability. The depegging of the stablecoin USDC, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, caused instability in the DeFi ecosystem. Concerns arose about whether Circle could redeem customers 1:1 USDC for USD having parts of its fund in Silicon Valley Bank. During a period of confusion in the crypto-asset ecosystem, USDC experienced a notable depegging, with its value dropping to $0.87 at one point. However, after Circle announced its commitment to cover any deficit resulting from Silicon Valley Bank's closure, the price of USDC rebounded to $0.97 on the same day. Additionally, following the U.S. Department of Treasury, Federal Reserve, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announcement of backstopping the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 12, the value of USDC on secondary markets recovered to $0.99. The depegging of USDC also affected another notable stablecoin called DAI, which is governed by MakerDAO. DAI is partly backed by USDC, and the instability of USDC caused instability for DAI as well. MakerDAO implemented emergency measures to address the depegging of DAI. The incident also had an impact on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Coinbase and Binance suspended USDC conversions due to high inflows of USDC, leading to a significant migration of USDC from CEXs to DEXs. Overall, the incident highlighted the risks and challenges associated with stablecoins. Stablecoins aim to maintain their value stability through three main structures: collateral backing, algorithm-based, and/or the credibility of the stablecoin’s issuer or governing body; which is also crucial in establishing and enforcing rules to maintain the stablecoin’s value. However, the challenge of maintaining stability is not unique to stablecoins; it is a classic problem which can be seen prominently in cases of fiat currency such as the Hong Kong Dollar and Swiss Franc. Additionally, the concentration of economic power and anti-competitive effects are also seen in traditional financial markets. At the same time, while the HKD’s mechanism provides stability, it does not generate yield. Stablecoins have the potential to earn yields but face risks due to the backing assets and issuer credibility. Consequently, the “safe money” model, which aims to generate profits, can be difficult to achieve in this context. The depegging of stablecoins revealed various risks, including systemic risk, market volatility, reputation risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, and regulatory risk. It also revealed the risks in traditional finance have extended to stablecoins and the DeFi ecosystem through their interconnected nature. It is essential to carefully manage the risks associated with stablecoins, ensure transparency and credibility of issuers, and take appropriate measures to address potential risks while considering the potential benefits they offer."
