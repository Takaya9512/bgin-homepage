abstract: "Rethink and acknowledge existing past instruments and experience. At the same time, does technology provide a different way to avoid risk transmitted to users and economies? If so, in what way?
Fundamentally question whether stablecoins and DeFi replicate the same problems and risks that Satoshi Nakamoto tried to address.
Explore the potential for more decentralized and robust stablecoin designs to minimize reliance on trust points and centralized elements."
