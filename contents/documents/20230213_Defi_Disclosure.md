abstract: 'The crypto-asset industry has seen a surge in DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, transactions since 2020. What does DeFi mean? DeFi itself has emerged recently and thus probably does not have a widely accepted definition (OECD, 2022). Nonetheless, DeFi has been explained in various ways in papers, reports, and speeches by various public organizations and academic researchers. For example, the FSB (Financial Stability Board) (2019) defines "decentralized financial" technology as "Technologies that have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need for one or more intermediaries or centralized processes in the provision of financial services.‚Äù The BIS (The Bank of International Settlements)(2021) says that the term DeFi refers to the financial applications run by smart contracts on a blockchain, typically a permissionless (ie, public) chain. Ushida and Angel (2021) also define it as a "financial application that could consist of a part of a decentralized financial system" to emphasize the aspect that it is an application.'
