abstract: "As blockchain could affect a wide range of social and economic activities, the way we fulfill social interests globally, which currently largely depends on regulation and its enforcement, may have to change as well. At this early stage of development, we should start designing new mechanisms to ensure the sustainable development of this new ecosphere by involving a wide range of stakeholders."
