title: 'Study Report on Selective Disclosure'
author: "XXX"
abstract: "IAM, Privacy and Key Management Study Group (IPWG) is chartered to provide guidance and good practice documents that describe Identity and Access management and its privacy considerations for access to crypto-currency exchange and its privacy considerations.
A user needs to provide its attributes when accessing a service, including crypto-currency exchange. The attribute needs to be certified as the service provider does not want a user to lie about its attribute. On the other hand, the user do not want to disclose all the attributes certified and want to selectively disclose its attribute according
to the service providerâ€™s needs.
In this document, we provide guidance on various types of selective disclosure protocols and discuss its merits and demerits."
