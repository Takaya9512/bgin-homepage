abstract: "This research paper examines the implications of Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), a
novel smart contract primitive introduced by E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, and Vitalik
Buterin (2022) “Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul”, to curb Web3’s “hyper
financialisation” and lack of tooling to enable social coordination. Web3 has lacked the
facilities for social coordination undermining the potential for rich-social context,
permitting a counter-productive cycle of plutocratic governance and superficial
pseudonymous interactions. NFTs, despite being considered a possible solution, have
also seen problems arising from its anonymous and transferable features. We are
intrigued by the implications of a token capable of storing and creating composable
non-capital value, which we refer to as “reputation value”. The possible application of
soulbound tokens ranges from, community badges, memberships, credentials,
accolades, and attestations.
In this research paper, we have constructed a comprehensive overview of SBTs,
analyzing SBT’s principle characteristics, features and implications. We discuss the
various technical, social, and ethical considerations when tokenizing “reputation value”.
We have evaluated the principles and rationale imparted by Weyl et al. (2022), in
relation to fundamental academic literature, practical technical examples, and the
philosophies of digital identity; ranging from Nick Szabo (1996; 1997), James Cameron
(2005), Nat Sakimura (2021), and EIPs relating to SBTs.
While we hope our work catalyzes further research internationally, we equally
intend to draw attention to cautionary warnings to ensure SBTs are deployed in a safe
and responsible manner, including the discussion on whether they should be deployed
at all. Since SBTs are closely related to consequential matters, for one digital identity, a
wide range of multi-stakeholders should come together and progress discussions
surrounding privacy, ethics, implementations and standards.
This is an early stage discussion and we hope to extend our discussion further in
future BGIN works. We welcome diversity of thought, and invite anyone interested to be
part of the discussion."
