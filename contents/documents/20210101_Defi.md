title: 'Present and Future of a Decentralized Financial System and the Associated Regulatory Considerations'
author: "XXX"
abstract: "With the advent of decentralized finance, which generally refers to “DeFi”, regulatory authorities are
paying increasing attention to the privacy, traceability, and identity aspects of DeFi systems to
address regulatory challenges that the development of the decentralized financial technologies
bring. While the rapid development of scaling and privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) by
open-source blockchain communities could enhance scalability and privacy protection, lack of
robust monitoring tools could adversely impact the ability of enforcement officers to trace financial
transactions for financial crime prevention. As each stakeholder has different goals and objectives,
there needs to be a venue for constructive dialogue to take place.
With this in mind, this document created under the current workstream, with contributions from
diverse stakeholders including engineers, regulators, financial institutions and industry, aims to
provide a source of reference especially for regulators and policy makers to have a collective
understanding by, for example, analyzing recent development of major DeFi projects and technical
advancements."
