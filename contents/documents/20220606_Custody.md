title: 'Incident Response of Decentralized Custody; A Case Study'
author: "XXX"
abstract: "Cryptocurrency custody has become a multi-billion-dollar industry as the number of users and volume of funds continues to grow exponentially within the industry. These funds are prime targets for Ransomware and hackers alike for theft. Social Engineering remains one of the highest vectors of attacks. Custody comes in multiple forms and some individuals within cryptocurrency have funds comparable to many institutions, yet, often have less rigorous security systems in place, making them not only targets as individuals but also as attack vectors into institutions. Therefore, the individual of today has to implement cybersecurity processes and tools not unlike those of institutions."
